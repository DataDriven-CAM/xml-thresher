# xml-thresher
binding from xml using c++ utf8/u16 and schema awareness

## To build and test

Note: currently working on a new package manager to use on this package.  Other managers should still 
work(as far as they do) as https://github.com/DataDriven-CAM/cnpm.git is based on the package.json npm format.

### cnpm building

```
cnpm  install

cnpm lib

#building and running unit tests
cnpm test

```
